Add all of the numbers chosen.  5. Enter total into the space provided.    After using Qigong Sensory Training therapy on your child once a day for a five months, have the same parent complete the form again. Total numbers circled. Compare this number to the number at the beginning. If Qigong Sensory Training therapy is being implemented successfully, the total number should decrease over  time."
